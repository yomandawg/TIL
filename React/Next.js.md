* Benefits
  * *Better SEO*, as the search engine crawls fully rendered page
  * *Faster time-to-content*, since the JavaScript codes don't need to be downloaded
* Trade-offs
  * *Development constraints*, optimizing the browser and bringing external libraries is challenging
  * *Difficult build setup*, such as Node.js environments on the server
  * *More server-side load*
* SSR vs Prerendering
  * Prerendering focuses on static HTML files for specific routes, rather than using a web server to compile HTML on runtime.
